# 🎮 Picker 3D Clone – A Hypercasual Game Recreation

A technical remake of the popular mobile game *Picker 3D* – built with Unity.  
This project focuses not just on replicating the gameplay, but on implementing clean code architecture, reusable systems, and design patterns to strengthen my game development skills.

## 📌 Project Purpose

This project was developed to:
- Practice scalable game architecture using **SOLID** principles.
- Gain hands-on experience with **design patterns** in a real-world Unity game.
- Improve productivity through editor tooling and modular design.
- Recreate a hypercasual experience while focusing on **technical depth**.
